# HotSpotMobility

Hot Spot Mobility to be run on ns3 version 3.37 (Not guaranteed any other version). This model is for 2D simulations and chooses waypoints off the straight-line path between current location and destination node.

Source code and header file included. Should be added in mobility/model. 

CMake updated to include hot spot mobility in build. Should be replacing the mobility's CMake file.
